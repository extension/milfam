== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I customize it to my site? =

The plugin will automatically try to detect the background color of your site, from white, black, green or any color in-between.  We'll shift around the text colors to make sure they are readable.

If you want to change the background color of your forum, you can set a div with a background color on the page your forum is embedded in and we'll use that.
