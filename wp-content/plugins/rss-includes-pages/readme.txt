Modifies RSS feeds so that they include pages and not just posts.

== Description ==

Modifies RSS feeds so that they include pages and not just posts. Deactivating the plugin restores RSS feeds to their default state.

Including pages in your feed is particularly useful if you're using WordPress as a CMS where pages represent a good portion of your content.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the rss-includes-feeds folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work with other RSS feed related plugins? =

Yes. The modifications to the feed are done at a low level and other plugins should remain compatible.

= I just activated the plugin, why don't I see pages in my feed? =

If you're using Feedburner you'll have to wait until your updated feed is picked up by Feedburner. This isn't immediate so give it a few hours. Also, WordPress caches feeds and doesn't rebuild it on the fly.
