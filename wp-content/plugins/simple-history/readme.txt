View changes made by users within WordPress. See who created a page, uploaded an attachment or approved an comment, and more.

== Description ==

Simple History shows recent changes made within WordPress, directly on your dashboard or on a separate page.

The plugin works as a log/history/audit log/version history of the most important events that occur in WordPress.

Out of the box Simple History has support for:

* **Posts and pages**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted a post or page
* **Attachments**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted an attachment
* **Comments**<br>
see who edited, approved or removed a comment
* **Widgets**<br>
get info when someone adds, updates or removes a widget in a sidebar
* **Plugins**<br>
activation and deactivation
* **User profiles**<br>
info about added, updated or removed users
* **User logins**<br>
see when a user login & logut
* **Failed user logins**<br>
see when someone has tried to log in, but failed. The log will then include ip address of the possible hacker.

There is also a **RSS feed of changes** available, so you can keep track of the changes made via your favorite RSS reader on your phone, on your iPad, or on your computer.

It’s a plugin that is good to have on websites where several people are
involved in editing the content.

#### Example scenarios

Keep track of what other people are doing:
_"Has someone done anything today? Ah, Sarah uploaded
the new press release and created an article for it. Great! Now I don't have to do that."_

Or for debug purposes:
_"The site feels very slow since yesterday. Has anyone done anything special? ... Ah, Steven activated 'naughy-plugin-x',
that must be it."_

#### See it in action

#### API so you can add your own events to Simple History

If you are a theme or plugin developer and would like to add your own things/events to Simple History you can do that by calling the function `simple_history_add()` like this:

`
<?php

if ( function_exists("SimpleLogger") ) {

    // Most basic example: just add some information to the log
    SimpleLogger()->info("This is a message sent to the log");

    // A bit more advanced: log events with different severities
    SimpleLogger()->info("User admin edited page 'About our company'");
    SimpleLogger()->warning("User 'Jessie' deleted user 'Kim'");
    SimpleLogger()->debug("Ok, cron job is running!");

}
?>
`

== Screenshots ==

1. The log view + it also shows the filter function in use - the log only shows event that
are of type post and pages and media (i.e. images & other uploads), and only events
initiated by a specific user.

2. Events with different severity – Simple History uses the log levels specified in the PHP PSR-3 standard.

3. Events have context with extra details - Each logged event can include useful rich formatted extra information. For example: a plugin install can contain author info and a the url to the plugin, and an uploaded image can contain a thumbnail of the image.

4. Click on the IP address of an entry to view the location of for example a failed login attempt.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.20 (February 2015) =

- Added: changes via [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) is now detected (was previously shown as "other").
- Added: severity level (info, warning, debug, etc.) of event is includes in the RSS output.
- Changed the way user login is logged. Should fix https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/40 + possible more related issues.
- Added: filter `simple_history/simple_logger/log_message_key` added, that can be used to shortcut log messages. See [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples.php) for usage. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stop-logging-certain-types-of-activity.
- Added: now uses object caching at some places. Should speed up some parts of the plugin for users with caching enabled.
- Fixed: IP info popup can now be closed with `esc`.
- Fixed: works better on small screens (like mobile phones) + misc other style related fixes.

= 2.0.19 (February 2015) =

- Added: Dutch translation by [https://github.com/niknetniko](https://github.com/niknetniko). Thanks!
- Changed: better compatibilty with plugins like [WP User Avatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/).
- Updated: German translation update.

= 2.0.18 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: really correctly show the version number of the previous version!

= 2.0.17 (January 2015) =

- Added: messages added using for example `SimpleLogger()->info( __("My log message") )` that have translations now auto translated the message back to english before storing the message (together with the text domain). Then upon retrieval it uses the english message + the text domain to translate the message to the currently selected language. This makes it easier to make multilingual log entries. (Yeah, I know its hard to understand what the heck this does, but it's something good and cool, trust me!)
- Added: A sidebar with text contents on the history page.
- Changed: Search now shows only the search box by default, with a link to show all search options.
- Fixed: Search is now available at the dashboard again. Hooray!
- Fixed: Old entries were not cleared automatically. Now it correctly removes old events, so your database will not risk growing to large.
- Fixed: Quick stats could show two messages sometimes.
- Fixed: When headers like `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` exists all valid IPs in that header is now stored.
- Fixed: Plugin updates via third party software like [InfiniteWP](http://infinitewp.com/) should now correctly show the version number of the previous version.
- Updated: German translation updated.
- Notice: Do you read these messages? Then you must love this plugin! Come on then, [go and give it a nice review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/simple-history).

= 2.0.16 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: Use the [X-Forwarded-For header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For), if it is set, to determine remote IP address. Should now correctly store IP addresses for servers behind load balancers or for clients going through proxies. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-x-forwarded-for-http-header-when-logging-remote_addr.
- Changed: Failed login attempts from unknown and known users are now grouped together. This change was made because a hacker could make many login attempts to a site and rotate the logins, so they would try with both existing and non existing user names, which would make the log flood with failed login attempts.
- Changed: use "n similar events" instead of "n more", to more cleary mark that the grouped events are not necessary exactly the same kind.
- Changed: Quick stats text changed, to also include other sources. Previous behavior was to only include events from WordPress users, but now also events from anonymous users and WordPress (like from WP-Cron) are included.

= 2.0.15 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: Widget changes where not always translated.
- Fixed: More RSS fixes to make feed valid. Maybe even for real this time.

- Added: Danish translation added. Thanks [ThomasDK81](https://github.com/ThomasDK81)!
- Misc translation fixes, for example the log levels where not translateable (it may be a good idea to keep the original English ones however because they are the ones that are common in other software).

= 2.0.13 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: RSS feed is now valid according to http://validator.w3.org/. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-feed-which-was-valid-under-v206-is-no-longer-under-v209-latest.

- Actually enable IP address lookup for all users. Sorry for missing to do that! ;)

= 2.0.8 (December 2014) =

- Added: IP addresses can now be clicked to view IP address info from [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io). This will get you the location and network of an IP address and help you determine from where for example a failed login attempt originates from. [See screenshot of IP address info in action](http://glui.me/?d=y89nbgmvmfnxl4r/ip%20address%20information%20popup.png/).
- Added: new action `simple_history/admin_footer`, to output HTML and JavaScript in footer on pages that belong to Simple History
- Added: new trigger for JavaScript: `SimpleHistory:logReloadStart`. Fired when the log starts to reload, like when using the pagination or using the filter function.
- Fixed: use Mustache-inspired template tags instead of Underscore default ones, because they don't work with PHP with asp_tags on.
- Updated: Swedish translation updated

= 2.0.7 (December 2014) =

- Fix: no message when restoring page from trash
- Fix: use correct width for media attachment
- Add: filter `simple_history/logrowhtmloutput/classes`, to modify HTML classes added to each log row item

= 2.0.6 (November 2014) =

Simple History now logs when a user is logged out from all their sessions except the current browser, or if an admin destroys all sessions for a user. [View screenshot of new session logout log item](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k4cmfmncekmfiib/2014-12-simple-history-changelog-user-sessions.png)

- Added: filter to shortcut loading of a dropin. Example that completely skips loading the RSS-feed-dropin:
`add_filter("simple_history/dropin/load_dropin_SimpleHistoryRSSDropin", "__return_false");`

= 0.3.6 =
- Made the RSS-feature a bit easier to find: added a RSS-icon to the dashboard window - it's very discrete, you can find it at the bottom right corner. On the Simple History page it's a bit more clear, at the bottom, with text and all. Enjoy!
- Added POT-file

= 0.3.5 =
- using get_the_title instead of fetching the title directly from the post object. should make plugins like qtranslate work a bit better.
- preparing for translation by using __() and _e() functions. POT-file will be available shortly.
- Could get cryptic "simpleHistoryNoMoreItems"-text when loading a type with no items.

= 0.3.4 =
- RSS-feed is now valid, and should work at more places (could be broken because of html entities and stuff)

= 0.3.3 =

- the name of deleted items now show up, instead of "Unknown name" or similar
- added support for plugins (who activated/deactivated what plugin)
- support for third party history items. Use like this:
simple_history_add("action=repaired&object_type=starship&object_name=USS Enterprise");
this would result in somehting like this:
Starship "USS Enterprise" repaired
by admin (John Doe), just now
- capability edit_pages needed to show history. Is this an appropriate capability do you think?
