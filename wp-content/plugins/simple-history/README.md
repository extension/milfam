are of type post and pages and media (i.e. images & other uploads), and only events

## Events have context with extra details

Each logged event can include useful rich formatted extra information. For example: a plugin install can contain author info and a the url to the plugin, and an uploaded image can contain a thumbnail of the image.

# Plugin API

Developers can easily log their own things using a simple API:

```php
<?php
// Add events to the log
SimpleLogger()->info("This is a message sent to the log");

// Add events of different severity
SimpleLogger()->info("User admin edited page 'About our company'");
SimpleLogger()->warning("User 'Jessie' deleted user 'Kim'");
SimpleLogger()->debug("Ok, cron job is running!");

```
