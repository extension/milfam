This is a simple plugin to keep the YouTube oEmbed from showing related videos.

== Description ==

WordPress' built-in oEmbed feature is fantastic. I've heard several complaints, though, about the related videos that show up after the video is done playing so I put together this very simple plugin that keeps the YouTube oEmbed code from showing related videos.

This plugin also adds wmode=transparent so that the flash object doesn't overlap a modal window.

On activation, the plugin clears the oEmbed cache so that the videos can be successfully re-cached with the new setting. If you are upgrading the plugin, you may need to manually deactivate, then reactivate it to clear the cache.

== Installation ==

Copy the folder to your WordPress
'*/wp-content/plugins/*' folder.

1. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin
1. That's it. There's nothing else to do. Really!

If you want to pass in some other parameters to the embedded url, you can do so with the `hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters` filter. Just make sure you end with an ampersand.

Add Something:

`add_filter("hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters", "my_hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters");
function my_hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters($str) {
	return "wmode=transparent&amp;MY_VAR_NAME=MY_VALUE&amp;";
}`


Remove the wmode=transparent:

`add_filter("hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters", "my_hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters");
function my_hyrv_extra_querystring_parameters($str) {
	return "";
}`

Be sure to leave an &amp; at the end of your string. After installing your filter, be sure to deactivate and reactivate the plugin.
